DIRECTIONS

Boil rice in plenty of salted water until cooked.
Rinse, drain and spread the rice to cool.
Do this at least two hours ahead, or preferably, leave overnight in the fridge.
Combine eggs with sesame oil and salt, and put aside (see below).
Heat wok or large frying pan over heat until hot.
Add oil, and wait until it is very hot and slightly smoking.
Add the onions, ginger, shrimp paste, garlic, and pepper, and stir-fry for 2 minutes, squashing the shrimp paste as you go.
Then add chicken and shrimp and stir-fry for a further 2 minutes.
Add rice and continue to stir-fry for 3 minutes.
Now add the chilli bean sauce or sambal oelek, oyster sauce and ketjap manis/dark soy sauce and continue to stir-fry for 2 minutes.
Finally, add egg mixture and continue to stir-fry for another minute.
Alternatively make 2 thin omelettes from the egg mixture ahead of time and cut into strips.
These can then be used as garnish on the finished dish.
Turn onto large serving platter and garnish with the spring onion and fresh cilantro, and serve hot.
